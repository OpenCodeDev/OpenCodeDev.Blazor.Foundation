# Introduction 
This project is a public package published by the company under MIT license and is the implementation of [Zurb Foundation 6](https://get.foundation/index.html) for Blazor C#.

To help developers focus on C# and Blazor, we've assembled an easy to use package featuring Zurb Foundation 6 components' script and style. 

Thus, the developer can expect to write less javascript to work with Zurb Foundation 6 and focus on writing C# and Blazor HTML.

The package is set to be very flexible and extensively maintained by us. Therefore, expect to see many future updates, tutorial, documentation, videos and more!

That being said, let get started! Unleash the power of Zurb Foundation 6 in the comfort of C#!
